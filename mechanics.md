the scan angle. The sector motor was able to sweep an
angle of 22 degrees at 65 Hz. By imaging during both the
forward and backward swing, a frame rate of 130 fps was
achieved with minimal image jitter.

The moving coil was
driven by a power amplifier controlled by a closed-loop pro-
portional, integral, and derivative (PID) servo control circuit. In
this new servo controller, the PID control was implemented in a
digital scheme using a field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA)
based circuit.

. In
the new design, the sector probe also incorporated a miniature
eddy current position sensor directly on the transducer mount-
ing cup to monitor the rotational position of the transducer. The
positional accuracy was calibrated to be better than ±1 ◦ any-
where in the scan angle.

The transducer was fixed onto a linear motor stage (PLS-85,
PI miCos, Eschbach, Germany) to allow linear imaging scans to
be performed. The motor was moved at a speed of 8 mm/s. The
image was constructed using two-times delayed-excitation
scanning with the 80 MHz ADC and four-times
delayed-excitation scanning with the 40 MHz ADC

To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric
element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly
cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit.

Hardware costs can be vastly reduced by sim-
plifying the transducer array to a single piezoelectric element, as
shown in Fig. 1, which is mechanically swept across the target
scene.

Fluctuations in
speed due to variable friction have no inherent effect on image
quality as the optical encoder determines when the transducer
is excited to ensure that the data is accurately captured.

This method of combining a single transducer
element and a mechanical actuator is unique in the context of
modern medical ultrasound imaging [5] [6] [7] [8]. This is a
compromise as the image quality is reduced but the cost
saving is significant (over 95% cost reduction).

The low electrical noise of the PM rotary actuator Voice Coil
Motor (VCM) is ideal for maintaining a high signal to noise
ratio of the echo data and the accurate positional encoder
allows the ultrasound image to be constructed at the end of
each scanning cycle.

ultrasound images with the help of motion sensors from a

with the data coming from the motion sensors

With this sweep rate, the subsystem
could collect RF data at 34 frames per second (fps) during
one-way swings or at 68 fps during 2-way swings. Under
this situation, the PRF should be theoretically 7.344 kHz
for 108 scanlines (68 × 108). Practically, however, the
PRF should be around 20 kHz because the sector motor
frequently decelerates and accelerates. Therefore, the time
duration during which the motor maintained a constant
speed, was a relatively short.

The ARM processor within Zynq SoC controls the components on the AFE via the serial peripheral interface
and provides excitation for the immersion-type 3.5 MHz piezoelectric transducer. Figure 7 shows the RUTS
components assembled to perform the system evaluation. Figure 8 shows the ultrasound experimental setup,
where the surface of the steel block with a flaw is scanned by using the transducer. The transducer is moved
with the help of a step motor [12].
