	abstract = {In medical ultrasound scanning, coaxial cables connects the transducer elements to the computing platforms. During scanning, these probes are hanging from sonographer hand and slides on the patient body providing discomfort for both patient and sonographer. To address this issue, we discussed the feasibility of realizing wireless ultrasound transducer and as a proof of concept we built the prototype of wireless ultrasound transducer based scanning system. The proposed system has two parts: wireless transducer with embedded pre-processing unit, and back-end module for image reconstruction and display purpose. The embedded pre-processing unit consist of analog and digital integrated circuits, transmit beamforming, low noise amplification, time gain compensation and receive beam forming. The output of wireless transducer is scanline data, which is transmitted to back-end module via wireless communication transceiver. The complete back-end module is implemented on a Zedboard platform which comes with FPGA and ARM processor. The signal processing algorithms, which include envelope detection, log compression, scan conversion, interpolation and decimation algorithms are implemented on FPGA, while ARM processor is used to control and coordinate between signal processing modules. The Wi-Fi 802.11n standard is used as a wireless communication transceiver between wireless transducer and back-end module. The wireless transducer prototype is designed for 64 element, 8 channel linear transducer. The proposed prototype of wireless transducer based scanning system is successfully tested by scanning a phantom.},

	abstract = {Mobile and cost effective ultrasound devices are used in point of care scenarios or the drama room. To reduce the costs of such devices we already presented the possibilities of consumer devices like the Apple iPad for full signal processing of raw data for ultrasound image generation. Emerging technologies like ultrafast ultrasound imaging result in new algorithms for example for shearwave elastography or vector velocity imaging but also enable the creation of a full image with only one excitation/reception event based on plane wave imaging. This way acquisition times and power consumption of ultrasound imaging can be reduced for low power mobile devices based on consumer electronics realizing the transition from FPGA or ASIC based beamforming into more flexible software beamforming. This is usually performed on a GPU utilizing massive parallel processing (like CUDA or OpenCL) but with the development of modern processors (A7, A8 and A8X) for its smartphones and tablets Apple introduced parallel GPU hardware and the framework “Metal” for advanced graphics and general purpose GPU processing for the iOS platform. We use it for medical signal reconstruction in the mobile plane wave beamforming and imaging on ultrasound channel data sets measured with our research systems “DiPhAS” in ultrafast imaging mode. We were able to integrate the beamforming reconstruction into our mobile ultrasound processing application on the iOS platform. The next step into realizing a mobile, fully software based ultrasound system was made. The beamforming can be performed at up to 62 Hz at reasonable image quality on iPad Air 2 hardware providing real time imaging including the post-processing of beamformed data into images (envelope detection and scan conversion).},

Each system presents specific performance in terms of number of channels, flexibility, processing power, data storage capability, and overall dimensions. This paper reports the design criteria and hardware/software implementation details of a new 256-channel ultrasound advanced open platform. This system is organized in a modular architecture, including multiple front-end boards, interconnected by a high-speed (80 Gb/s) ring, capable of finely controlling all transmit (TX) and receive (RX) signals. High flexibility and processing power (equivalent to 2500 GFLOP) are guaranteed by the possibility of individually programming multiple digital signal processors and field programmable gate arrays. Eighty GB of on-board memory are available for the storage of prebeamforming, postbeamforming, and baseband data. The use of latest generation devices allowed to integrate all needed electronics in a small size (34 cm×30 cm×26 cm). The system implements a multiline beamformer that allows obtaining images of 96 lines by 2048 depths at a frame rate of 720 Hz (expandable to 3000 Hz). The multiline beamforming capability is also exploited to implement a real-time vector Doppler scheme in which a single TX and two independent RX apertures are simultaneously used to maintain the analysis over a full pulse repetition frequency range.},

This paper focuses on the investigation of the effects of architectural design choices on the image quality. The point spread function is simulated in Field II from 10 to 160 mm using a convex array transducer. A noise analysis is performed, and the minimum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) requirements are derived for the low-noise amplifiers (LNAs) and A/D converters (ADCs) to fulfill the design specifications of a dynamic range of 60 dB and a penetration depth of 160 mm in the B-mode image. Six front-end implementations are compared using Nyquist-rate and Σ∆ modulator ADCs. The image quality is evaluated as a function of the depth in terms of lateral full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and -12-dB cystic resolution (CR). The designs that minimally satisfy the specifications are based on an 8-b 30-MSPS Nyquist converter and a single-bit third-order 240-MSPS Σ∆ modulator, with an SNR for the LNA in both cases equal to 64 dB. The mean lateral FWHM and CR are 2.4\% and 7.1\% lower for the Σ∆ architecture compared with the Nyquist-rate one. However, the results generally show minimal differences between equivalent architectures. Advantages and drawbacks are finally discussed for the two families of converters.},

The transducer samples a 3-D volume by simultaneous rotation and translation, giving a helical motion. Two different 3-D SAF methods are investigated, a direct and a two-step approach. Both methods perform almost identically for simulated scatterers and give a significant improvement in azimuth resolution and a constant resolution in elevation. Side lobes below -60 dB are achievable for both methods. Validation of the method is achieved by scanning a simple wire phantom and a complex phantom containing wires in azimuth and elevation. The simple wire phantom shows the same results as that found through simulation. The complex phantom shows simultaneous focusing in azimuth and elevation for the wire scatterers. Consideration of the processing requirements for both 3-D SAF methods shows that the two-step approach can give equivalent performance using an order of magnitude fewer calculations. This reduction requires a temporary storage of 9.1 GB of data for the investigated setup.},

The proposed synthetic aperture method offers good dynamical resolution along with fast numerical reconstruction. In this study complex object data were recorded coherently in a two-dimensional hologram using a 3.5 MHz single transducer with a fairly wide-angle beam. Image reconstruction which applies the wavefront backward propagation method and the near-field curvature compensation was performed numerically in a microcomputer using the spatial frequency domain. This approach allows an efficient use of the FFT-algorithms. Because of the simple and fast scanning scheme and the efficient reconstruction algorithms the method can be made real-time. The image quality of the proposed method was studied by evaluating the spatial and dynamical resolution in a waterbath and in a typical tissue-mimicking phantom. The lateral as well as the range resolution (-6 dB) were approximately 1 mm in the depth range of 30-100 mm. The dynamical resolution could be improved considerably when the beam width was made narrower. Although it resulted in a slightly reduced spatial resolution this compromise has to be done for better resolution of low-contrast targets such as cysts. The study showed that cysts as small as 2 mm by diameter could be resolved.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Recently, several hand-held echo devices are going on market and they are expected to play a role as "visible" auscultation instead of stethoscope. We have developed a portable and inexpensive echo device which can be used for screening of cardiac function. Two single element transducers were attached 180 degrees apart to a rotor with 14-mm diameter. The mechanical scanner, integrated circuits for transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals and an A/D converter were encapsulated in a 150 x 40 mm probe weighing 200 g. The scan was started and the image was displayed on a Windows based personal computer (PC) as soon as the probe was connected to USB 2.0 port of the PC. The central frequency was available between 2.5 and 7.5 MHz, the image depth was 15 cm and the frame rate was 30/s. The estimated price of this ultra-portable ultrasound is about 3000 US dollars with software. For 69 cardiac patients with informed consent, image quality was compared with those obtained with basic range diagnostic echo machines. Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) derived from normal M-mode image of standard machines (EFm) were compared with visual EF of the ultra-portable ultrasound device (EFv). The image quality was comparable to the basic range diagnostic echo machines although short axis view of aortic root was not clearly visualized because the probe was too large for intercostal approach. EFv agreed well with EFm. The ultra-portable ultrasound may provide useful information on screening and health care.},

Unfortunately, ultrasound is nearly absent in many rural healthcare facilities in developing regions due to the high costs of both equipment and required training. To leverage existing healthcare systems commonly found in these contexts, we have focused our efforts on increasing the diagnostic capabilities of midwives -- often central medical figures in rural and low-income communities. We have designed and built a low-cost portable ultrasound device consisting of a USB ultrasound probe and a touchscreen netbook for a total cost of around USD3500. Compared to currently available ultrasound devices, we simplified the user interface while maintaining functionality to allow midwives to detect three common obstetrical conditions: placenta previa, multiple gestations, and breech presentation. To evaluate our solution, we tested the accuracy of ultrasound measurements, image quality, and whether midwives could use ultrasound. Testing performed by nine clinicians indicated our device would be appropriate for identifying the three conditions. Our modular design approach allows for easy modification, and the device is designed to utilize existing local healthcare resources in order to create a sustainable solution that does not depend on continuous foreign assistance.},

	abstract = {Recently there have been major advances in the electro-mechanical design of upper extremity prosthetics. However, the development of control strategies for such prosthetics has lagged significantly behind. Conventional noninvasive myoelectric control strategies rely on the amplitude of electromyography (EMG) signals from flexor and extensor muscles in the forearm. Surface EMG has limited specificity for deep contiguous muscles because of cross talk and cannot reliably differentiate between individual digit and joint motions. We present a novel ultrasound imaging based control strategy for upper arm prosthetics that can overcome many of the limitations of myoelectric control. Real time ultrasound images of the forearm muscles were obtained using a wearable mechanically scanned single element ultrasound system, and analyzed to create maps of muscle activity based on changes in the ultrasound echogenicity of the muscle during contraction. Individual digit movements were associated with unique maps of activity. These maps were correlated with previously acquired training data to classify individual digit movements. Preliminary results using ten healthy volunteers demonstrated this approach could provide robust classification of individual finger movements with 98\% accuracy (precision 96\%-100\% and recall 97\%-100\% for individual finger flexions). The change in ultrasound echogenicity was found to be proportional to the digit flexion speed (R2=0.9), and thus our proposed strategy provided a proportional signal that can be used for fine control. We anticipate that ultrasound imaging based control strategies could be a significant improvement over conventional myoelectric control of prosthetics.},

	abstract = {The Universal Serial Bus (USB) is now the ubiquitous interface bus of choice for connecting peripherals to personal computers and laptops. USB 2.0 is a half-duplex bus running at 480 Mb/s and each peripheral can draw as much as 500 mA of current at a nominal 5 V from the USB connector. We have developed a family of USB-based, B-mode probes that connect directly to a personal computer or laptop and that draw as little as 250 mA (1.25 W) when forming ten 5 MHz images/second. The pulser/receiver, high voltage supply, analog-to-digital converter, servo and USB interface are implemented on a small circuit board inside the probe body. After raw data are transferred to the computer, gain compensation, interpolation, filtering and other data processing are performed by the host processor. This gives flexibility to developers and allows enhancements to the system to be incorporated via software updates. In addition, the raw data are available for storage and later postprocessing. There are several advantages to this architectural approach to B-mode imaging, including low cost, portability and optimal signal-to-noise performance. This paper describes the advantages of the architecture of the probe family, discusses the hardware/software division of the required processing steps and presents example images from a 12.5 MHz ophthalmic probe.},

	abstract = {The resolution of medical ultrasound systems is usually characterized by the width of the mainlobe, typically the full width at half maximum (FWHM), in beamplots. The FWHM has, however, been shown to sometimes provide misleading information about systems. The concept of "cystic resolution" in which performance is quantified as the size of the void that produces a specified contrast, has been previously introduced to medical ultrasound. We extend the concept and develop a general metric to analyze the 3D broadband performance of arbitrary ultrasound systems. We provide an example of application in which we compare the performance of a conventional system using a 1D array and time delay beamforming of radiofrequency (RF) data to that of a system based on a 2D array that focuses solely via phase rotation of complex I/Q data formed by directly sampling the received RF signal.},

Phased-array techniques are not practically applicable at such a high frequency, due to the too small size required for the single transducer element, and mechanical scanning is the only practical alternative. At present, all ophthalmic ultrasound systems use focused single-element, mechanically scanned probes. A good probe positioning and image evaluation feedback requires an image refresh-rate of about 15-30 frames per second, which is achieved in commercial mechanical scanning probes by using electromagnetic motors. In this work, we report the design, construction, and experimental characterization of the first mechanical scanning probe for ophthalmic echography based on a small piezoelectric ultrasound motor. The prototype probe reaches a scanning rate of 15 sectors per second, with very silent operation and little weight. The first high-frequency echographic images obtained with the prototype probe are presented.},

	abstract = {Spatial resolution in modern ultrasound imaging systems is limited by the high cost of large aperture transducer arrays, which require a large number of transducer elements and electronic channels. A new technique to enhance the spatial resolution of pulse-echo imaging systems is presented. The method attempts to build an image that could be obtained with a transducer array aperture larger than that physically available. We consider two images of the same object obtained with two different apertures, the full aperture and a subaperture, of the same transducer. A suitable artificial neural network (ANN) is trained to reproduce the relationship between the image obtained with the transducer full aperture and the image obtained with a subaperture. The inputs of the neural network are portions of the image obtained with the subaperture (low resolution image), and the target outputs are the corresponding portions of the image produced by the full aperture (high resolution image). After the network is trained, it can produce images with almost the same resolution of the full aperture transducer, but using a reduced number of real transducer elements. All computations are carried out on envelope-detected decimated images; for this reason, the computational cost is low and the method is suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method was applied to experimental data obtained with the ultrasound synthetic aperture focusing technique (SAFT), giving quite promising results. Realtime implementation on a modern, full-digital echographic system is currently being developed.},

It is also possible to assure reduced bias and uncertainty in critical TOF measurements, such as those involving low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) as well as severe distortion of echo shape. A number of numerical tests are conducted on simulated signals with the aim of highlighting the good performance of the method when operating in critical conditions; to reduce the computational burden without losing significance in the analysis, a statistical experimental design-based technique is enlisted. Results attained in TOF-based distance measurements finally assess the method's reliability and efficacy even in the presence of actual ultrasonic signals.},

Analytic signal processing is used to improve pulse resolution. A real-time analytic processor was built using single-sideband (SBB) AM techniques. An upper sideband processor using the filter method to maximize signal bandwidth and in which the lower sideband aliases was built. This processor has a transducer bandwidth of 0.5 to 20 MHz and can resolve echoes 90-ns apart. The spurious products of practical mixers and amplifiers make the aliased approach impractical due to high noise and distortion. By using a bandpass filter after the mixer, distortion is reduced. A processor built with a lower sideband filter method yielded the lowest distortion and noise. The lower sideband processor has a bandwidth of 2 to 42 MHz and can resolve echoes 60-ns apart. With a single-cycle tone-burst processor input, ringing in the IF filter causes temporal asymmetry of the output pulse, while ringing in the detector filter causes ringing in the output pulse. Performance is expected to improve through the design of optimized filters. The ringing is less with ultrasonic echoes, because they do not start and stop as abruptly as a tone burst},

The paper presents the basis of the technique and analyzes the sources of error and its sensitivity to noise and signal bandwidth. Results of experiments with simulated signals are in good agreement with the theoretical model. Furthermore, EDF allows a straightforward implementation using a pipeline of two registers and a memory look-up table. The hardware implementation of EDP has been tested at a 10 MS/s, although current technology could achieve several times this throughput rate. Results obtained with EDF for real data of nondestructive testing experiments, are compared with those provided by the full precision analytical signal magnitude obtained by a software Hilbert transform. In all cases, no significant differences are appreciated between the analytical signal magnitude and the EDF output, which is computed in much less time},

The presented architecture combines 2 finite impulse response (FIR) filters to process in-phase and quadrature signals and includes a piecewise linear approximation architecture that performs the required square root operations. The proposed implementation enables flexibility to support different transducers with its ability to load on-the-fly different FIR filter coefficient sets. The complexity and accuracy of the demodulator processor are analyzed with simulated RF data; a normalized residual sum-of-squares cost function is used for comparison with the Matlab Hilbert function. Three implementations are integrated into a hand-held ultrasound system for experimental accuracy and performance evaluation. Real-time images were acquired from a reference phantom, demonstrating the feasibility of using the presented architecture to perform real-time digital quadrature demodulation of ultrasonic signal echoes. Experimental results show that the implementation, using only 2942 slices and 3 dedicated digital multipliers of a low-cost and low-power field-programmable gate array (FPGA) is accurate relative to a comparable software- based system; axial and lateral resolution of 1 mm and 2 mm, respectively, were obtained with a 12-mm piezoelectric transducer without postprocessing. Because the processing and sampling rates are the same, high-frequency ultrasound signals can be processed as well. For a 15-frame-per-second display, the hand-held ultrasonic imaging-processing core (FPGA, memory) requires only 45 mW (dynamic) when using a 5-MHz single-element piezoelectric transducer.},

	abstract = {High-frequency ultrasound imaging (at {\textgreater}20 MHz) has gained widespread attention due to its high spatial resolution being useful for basic cardiovascular and cancer research involving small animals. The sampling rate of the analog-to-digital converter in a high-frequency ultrasound system usually needs to be higher than 120 MHz in order to satisfy the Nyquist sampling-rate requirement. However, the sampling rate is typically within the range of 40-60 MHz in a traditional ultrasound system, and so we propose a delayed-excitation method for performing high-frequency ultrasound imaging with a traditional data acquisition scheme. In this method, the transmitted pulse is delayed by a certain time period so that the ultrasound echo data are aligned into high-sampling-rate slots. Wire and tissue-mimicking phantoms were imaged to evaluate the performance of the proposed method, whereas a porcine small-intestine specimen and an excised rabbit eyeball were used for in vitro imaging evaluations. The test results demonstrate that the proposed method allows high-frequency ultrasound imaging to be implemented using a traditional ultrasound sampling system.},

The FPGA is used to control, acquire, store, delay-and-sum, and transfer the data for real-time co-registered imaging. The FPGA controls the ultrasound transmission and ultrasound and photoacoustic data acquisition process of a customized 16-channel module that contains all of the necessary analog and digital circuits. The 16-channel module is one of multiple modules plugged into a motherboard; their beamformed outputs are made available for a digital signal processor (DSP) to access using an external memory interface (EMIF). The FPGA performs a key role through ultrafast reconfiguration and adaptation of its structure to allow real-time switching between the two imaging modes, including transmission control, laser synchronization, internal memory structure, beamforming, and EMIF structure and memory size. It performs another role by parallel accessing of internal memories and multi-thread processing to reduce the transfer of data and the processing load on the DSP. Furthermore, because the laser will be pulsing even during ultrasound pulse-echo acquisition, the FPGA ensures that the laser pulses are far enough from the pulse-echo acquisitions by appropriate time-division multiplexing (TDM). A co-registered ultrasound and photoacoustic imaging system consisting of four FPGA modules (64-channels) is constructed, and its performance is demonstrated using phantom targets and in vivo mouse tumor models.},

This array based pulsed-wave Doppler system included a 16-channel HF analog beamformer, a HF pulsed-wave Doppler module, timing circuits, HF bipolar pulsers, and analog front-ends. The beamformed echoes acquired by the 16 channel analog beamformer, were directly fed to the HF pulsed-wave Doppler module. Then the in-phase and quadrature-phase (IQ) audio Doppler signals were digitized by either a sound card or a Gage digitizer and stored in a PC. The Doppler spectrogram was displayed on a PC in real time. The two-way beam-widths were determined to be 160 μm to 320 μm when the array was electronically focused at different focal points at depths from 5–10 mm. A micro flow phantom, consisting of a polyimide tube with inner diameter of 127 μm, and the wire phantom were used to evaluate and calibrate the system. The results show that the system is capable of detecting motion velocity of the wire phantom as low as 0.1 mm/s, and detecting blood-mimicking flow velocity in the 127 μm tube lower than 7 mm/s. The system was subsequently used to measure the blood flow in vivo in two mouse abdominal superficial vessels with diameters of approximately 200 μm, and a mouse aorta close to the heart. These results demonstrated that this system may become an indispensable part of the current HF array based imaging systems for small animal studies.},

In this paper, a technique for in vivo mechanical strain imaging of the skin based on high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) is presented. Elastic skin properties are assessed applying suction to the skin surface with a stepwise increased vacuum and estimating the resulting displacements in a spatially resolved manner. Acquired radio frequency (R-F) echo signals and their envelope are analyzed for this purpose. A computer-controlled vacuum system with a digital pressure control loop was developed for precise and reproducible deformation. In a first processing step, the skin surface is segmented. Local axial strains inside the skin are estimated from axial displacements, which are estimated from consecutive echo signal frames analyzing the phase of the complex cross correlation function of analytical echo signals. Furthermore, speckle tracking is applied to estimate axial and lateral displacements and to quantify axial and lateral strains. The correlation coefficient of windowed echo signals compensated for displacements are used as a measure to validate the estimated strains, which is essential to accomplish reliable in vivo measurements. Phantom experiments were performed to validate the proposed technique. Results of in vivo measurements are presented, showing the potential for mechanical strain imaging in the skin in vivo.},

A great limitation of previous high frequency systems has been the requirement to water-couple the mechanically-scanned transducer to the object to be imaged, and slowly scan the transducer using a fixed motion system. In this system, we have integrated a high-speed actuator used in conjunction with a low mass transducer enclosed in a hand-held scanhead, which allows direct placement on the eyelid or skin. The design of this system is optimized for high frame rates and clinical versatility. Implemented on this system are B-scan, M-mode, and swept-scan imaging modes, with velocity estimation in the latter two. A series of experiments were performed to characterize system performance. The system provides a frame rate of 10 fps, which is partially limited by the execution time of the software.

As previous designs have utilized costly electromagnetic motors, for the mechanical scanning translation, this mechanical scanning mechanism provides a highly simplified alternative. The mechanical scanning mechanism utilizes a single piezoelectric bimorph as the actuating element. Laser Doppler analysis of the transducer motion has shown that transducer deflections greater than 10 mm can be obtained for a large range of frequencies, from 40 to 120 Hz. This, in turn, results in a maximum theoretical frame rate of 240 fps. Peak deflections greater than 20 mm can be obtained at the scanning mechanism resonance (110 Hz). Additionally, an analysis of the transducer phase relative to the input voltage has shown that high phase stability (+/- 1.4 degrees) potentially eliminates the need for position encoders, further reducing the device complexity and cost.},

	abstract = {In this paper a low cost open source approach to high-frequency ultrasound imaging is described. This complete imaging system is based around four core components: A single-element geometrically focused imaging transducer, a low cost high frame-rate mechanical scanner, a field programmable gate array (FPGA) controlled pulser-receiver unit, and a data acquisition system running open source interface software. The single-element imaging transducer is spherically curved composite based on Lithium Niobate that has a centre frequency of 45 MHz, a bandwidth of 65\%, and an insertion loss of -19dB. The mechanical scanning mechanism is based on a 45 mm long PZT bimorph attached to an extension arm. The mechanism can scan up to a 10 mm displacements at 100 Hz and is driven with a low cost Arduino microcontroller. The mechanism is mounted in an enclosed probe holder filled with deionized water. The FPGA accurately controlling the variable timing of the pulser-receiver unit is a Xilinx Virtex V and the data acquisition hardware consists of an off the shelf AlazarTech PCIe digitizing card and a PC. The hardware communication, GUI/plotting libraries, and data collection is all controlled with an open source Python application we have named OpenHiFUS.},

DSIQ beamforming is a low cost approach that relies on phase rotation of in-phase/quadrature (I/Q) data to implement focusing. The I/Q data are generated by directly sampling the received radio frequency (RF) signal, rather than through conventional baseband demodulation. We describe our efficient hardware implementation of the beamformer, which results in significant reductions in beamformer size and cost. We also present the results of experiments and simulations that compare the DSIQ beamformer to more conventional approaches, namely time delay beamforming and traditional complex demodulated I/Q beamforming. Results that show the effect of an error in the direct sampling process, as well as dependence on signal bandwidth and system f number (f\#) are presented. These results indicate that the image quality and robustness of the DSIQ beamformer are adequate for routine applications.},

	abstract = {RÉSUMÉ  Cette thèse se rapporte à la conception d’une nouvelle architecture d’un système d’appareils d’imagerie médicale par ultrasons (IMU); nous proposons une architecture matérielle d’un processeur dédié au prétraitement de signaux ultrasoniques en temps réel, qui intègre un cœur (core) de traitement, un module d’interpolation et un module d’assignation de priorités qui permet de partager le bus de données d’une mémoire à faible consommation d’énergie. Ce processeur dédié représente une contribution importante aux efforts visant à l’intégration complète d’un système de prétraitement de signaux ultrasoniques à l’intérieur d’une sonde qui fait partie des appareillages ultrasoniques conventionnels ainsi qu’à la mise en œuvre d’un nouveau type d’appareil d’IMU sans fil.
La littérature des deux dernières décennies présente diverses approches visant à miniaturiser la technologie de l’IMU. Plusieurs auteurs proposent des solutions en matière d’intégration des circuits frontaux ou de matérialisation de nouveaux algorithmes de traitement des signaux ultrasoniques. Les efforts de recherche dans ce domaine sont propulsés par l’intérêt grandissant des marchés et par le développement de nouvelles applications qui bénéficient de la miniaturisation de cette technologie. De plus, les performances grandissantes des circuits intégrés programmables tels que les FPGA offrent les caractéristiques appropriées pour la mise en œuvre de nouveaux systèmes d’IMU.----------ABSTRACT
This Ph.D. thesis is related to the design of a new architecture of ultrasound medical imaging (UMI) system. We propose a fully hardware-based processor dedicated to real-time ultrasonic signal processing, which incorporates a preprocessing core, a low-power memory, an interpolation unit, and a priority assignment unit. This Ph.D. thesis represents an important contribution towards the complete integration of an ultrasound preprocessing system within the probe and the implementation of a new type of wireless UMI device.  During the last two decades, several UMI system miniaturization approaches have been presented in the literature. Some Authors proposed their front-end circuit integration and introduced hardware-based ultrasound signal processing units based on new algorithms. Research efforts in this area are driven by the increasing industrial interest on miniaturized UMI devices and by the development of new applications that benefit from the miniaturization of this technology. Moreover, the increasing performance of programmable circuits, such as FPGA, offers appropriate characteristics for the implementation of new UMI systems.  Most UMI system architectures found in the literature are based in whole or in part on a software implementation that uses a central processing unit (CPU) or a digital signal processor (DSP). This software approach provides flexibility and facilitates the implementation of processing algorithms which are becoming ever more effective and complex. However, to provide real-time ultrasound image processing, these systems require high-power consumption or are too large for a complete system integration on a single chip (SoC).},

Portable ultrasound imaging systems have been developed based on application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).

The recent advance in application processors (APs) and graphics processing units embedded in smartphones can facilitate smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging systems. In this paper, the feasibility of the smartphone-based portable ultrasound imaging system is demonstrated where the high-end Android smartphone (i.e., Samsung's Galaxy Note II) is used for performing core ultrasound B-mode signal and image processing (e.g., quadrature demodulation and scan conversion). The ultrasound B-mode image reconstructed from the Android smartphone where an 850×800 image is reconstructed and displayed.

This review takes a look at some of the attempts which have been published, as well as some of the issues which have still yet to be resolved. In conclusion, low-cost portable ultrasound has the capability to be developed and commercialized, but until a suitable replacement to piezoelectric crystals has been developed (possibly CMUTs?) low-cost portable ultrasound system will be held back by the high cost burden associated with the cost of piezoceramics.},

In this paper, we propose an architecture for a PUS system, whose abilities include automated kidney detection in real time. Automated kidney detection is performed by training the Viola–Jones algorithm with a good set of kidney data consisting of diversified shapes and sizes. It is observed that the kidney detection algorithm delivers very good performance in terms of detection accuracy.

	abstract = {A compact medical ultrasound beamformer architecture that uses oversampled 1-bit analog-to-digital (A/D) converters is presented. Sparse sample processing is used, as the echo signal for the image lines is reconstructed in 512 equidistant focal points along the line through its in-phase and quadrature components. That information is sufficient for presenting a B-mode image and creating a color flow map. The high sampling rate provides the necessary delay resolution for the focusing. The low channel data width (1-bit) makes it possible to construct a compact beamformer logic. The signal reconstruction is done using finite impulse response (FIR) filters, applied on selected bit sequences of the delta-sigma modulator output stream. The approach allows for a multichannel beamformer to fit in a single field programmable gate array (FPGA) device. A 32-channel beamformer is estimated to occupy 50\% of the available logic resources in a commercially available midrange FPGA, and to be able to operate at 129 MHz. Simulation of the architecture at 140 MHz provides images with a dynamic range approaching 60 dB for an excitation frequency of 3 MHz.},

	abstract = {The applications of ultrasound in medicine have been increasing in the last decade either in diagnostics or in treatments. Ultrasound is routinely used in clinical examinations, such as pregnancy exams. On the other hand, a typical ultrasound system costs somewhere between 100k\$ to 250k\$ because of its (1) expensive ultrasound transducers, (2) large driving electronics, (3) processing and visualization units. High cost and large volume of the ultrasound systems prevent even wider usage of these systems. It is possible to extent the use of ultrasound in clinic environment like a stethoscope, if the size and cost had been reduced orders of magnitude. The aim of this work is to develop an ultraportable and very low cost diagnostic ultrasound imaging probe; by combining inertial sensors with the probes. The manual motion of the probe by the operator's hand movement enables scanning. The position of the probe is tracked using inertial sensors. Finally, the acoustic reflections are registered together by the help of position information of the probe to form an image.},

The focus of this work was to develop an easy-to-use platform kit (hardware and software) for providing the community a complete experimental setup for ultrasound imaging at a low cost, without the need for expensive and non-modifiable specific equipment. The goal of this work resembles the needs of medical systems in the 80’s where analog techniques using single-sensor devices were prominent. To this end, two open-source, arduino-like modules have been developed for building a simple, yet complete, single-channel analog front-end system, where all the intermediary signals are readily accessible by the user. A single-channel architecture avoids the beamforming overhead, though it limits the quality of the captured image, and brings simplicity to the system. The modules were tested using re-purposed ultrasound mechanical probes, as well as non-medical transducers. Furthermore, different digital acquisition systems were utilized for providing the images of interest. The developed modules can also be used in Radio Frequency (RF) projects, non-destructive testing and control projects, as well as in low-cost medical imaging projects on non-living samples.},

Video capsule endoscopy is currently commercially available worldwide. However, it is limited to visualization of superficial tissue. Ultrasound (US) imaging is a complementary solution as it is capable of acquiring transmural information from the tissue wall. This paper presents a mechanical scanning device incorporating a high-frequency transducer specifically as a proof of concept for US capsule endoscopy (USCE), providing information that may usefully assist future research. A rotary solenoid-coil-based motor was employed to rotate the US transducer with sectional electronic control. A set of gears was used to convert the sectional rotation to circular rotation. A single-element focused US transducer with 39-MHz center frequency was used for high-resolution US imaging, connected to an imaging platform for pulse generation and image processing. Key parameters of US imaging for USCE applications were evaluated. Wire phantom imaging and tissue phantom imaging have been conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. A porcine small intestine specimen was also used for imaging evaluation in vitro. Test results demonstrate that the proposed device and rotation mechanism are able to offer good image resolution ( 60 μm) of the lumen wall, and they, therefore, offer a viable basis for the fabrication of a USCE device.},

Since the probe orientation is the main information involved in the pose reconstruction, this work presents and investigates several tracking methods for the probe orientation, exploiting a sensor fusion technique to filter the noisy measurements coming from inertial sensors. The performances of a Kalman filter, a nonlinear complementary filter and a quaternion-based filter as inertial trackers have been tested by means of a robot manipulator, in terms of readiness, accuracy and stability of the estimated orientation signal. The results show that the nonlinear complementary filter and the quaternion-based filter match all the application requirements (RMSE {\textless}3deg, variance {\textless}1deg2, and settling time {\textless}0.3s), and they involve a lower computational time with respect to the Kalman filter.},

	abstract = {There has been an emerging interest in high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) for therapeutic applications. By means of its thermal or mechanical effects, HIFU is able to serve as a direct tool for tissue ablation, or an indirect moderating medium to manipulate microbubbles or perform heating (hyperthermia) for the purpose of targeted drug delivery. The development and testing of HIFU based phased arrays is favorable as their elements allow for individual phasing to steer and focus the beam. While FDA has already approved tissue ablation by HIFU for the treatment of uterine fibroids (2004) and pain from bone metastases (2012), development continues on other possible applications that are less forgiving of incomplete treatment, such as thermal necrosis of malignant masses.Ideally, each element, of such an array must have its own fully programmable electrical driving channel, which allows the control of delay, phase, and amplitude of the output from each element. To enable full control, each channel needs a waveform generator, an amplification device, and an impedance matching circuit between driver and acoustic element.Similar projects utilizing this approach to drive therapeutic arrays include a 512-channel therapy system which was built at the University of Michigan using low cost Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) microcontroller and highly efficient MOSFET switching amplifiers [1]. However, this system lacks the ability to drive both, continuous wave (CW) and transient short duty-cycle high power pulses.This paper presents a hybrid system, which is able to perform CW and transient short duty-cycle high power excitation. In the following we will describe the design, programming, fabrication, and evaluation of this radiofrequency (RF) driver system as used in our laboratory for a 1.5 MHz center frequency, 298-element array (Imasonic SA, Besancon, France) [2], FPGA-controlled amplifier boards and matching circuitry. Advantages of our design include: 1. Inexpensive components ({\textless}\$15/channel); 2. Ability to program/drive individual output channels independently; 3. Sufficient time and amplitude resolution for various acoustic pattern design; 4. Capability of hybrid switching between low power CW and short duty cycle, high instantaneous power.},

Very recently, the discovery of compressive sensing has shown that the signal structure can be exploited to reduce the burden posed by traditional sensing requirements. In this spirit, we have designed a simple ultrasound imaging device that can perform three-dimensional imaging using just a single ultrasound sensor. Our device makes a compressed measurement of the spatial ultrasound field using a plastic aperture mask placed in front of the ultrasound sensor. The aperture mask ensures that every pixel in the image is uniquely identifiable in the compressed measurement. We demonstrate that this device can successfully image two structured objects placed in water. The need for just one sensor instead of thousands paves the way for cheaper, faster, simpler, and smaller sensing devices and possible new clinical applications.
Compressive 3D ultrasound imaging is possible with only one sensor and a simple aperture coding mask.

The major image processing algorithms were achieved by the novel field programmable technology for high speed and flexibility. Real-time imaging processing was achieved by fast processing algorithms and high speed data transfer interface. Extensive tests including hardware, algorithms, wire phantom, and tissue mimicking phantom measurements were conducted to demonstrate good performance of the platform. The calculated contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the tissue phantom measurements were higher than 1.2 in the range of 3.8-8.7 mm imaging depth.

	abstract = {Pulse generator is the critical component in all ultrasound systems for driving a piezoelectric transducer to medical or nondestructive testing (NDT) applications. The transducer in ultrasound system was driven by a pulse train generator, which delivers high-voltage bipolar or unipolar pulse train. Several recent papers have discussed both the importance and the design of unipolar and bipolar pulse generator for ultrasound applications. Bipolar voltage pulse has lower unwanted DC and low-frequency component could decrease the leakage current. Also, its peak-to-peak pulse voltage could achieve twice of the voltage rating of the coaxial cable connecting the generator and the transducer. In current commercial ultrasound systems, bipolar pulse generators are commonly used; however, it still had some disadvantages like longer pulse length, which limited the driving frequency and affect the signal performance. This paper purposed a novel design of bipolar pulse generator based on a novel dual P-N channel MOSFET and FPGA timing control. It could produce multi-cycle pulses with center frequency over 50 MHz and shorter pulse length. This design also preserved the low-cost advantage compared to other commercial design of bipolar pulse generator. It is suitable for high-frequency ultrasound Doppler and B-mode imaging applications.},

	abstract = {Many opportunities exist in medical ultrasound research for experimenting with novel designs, both of transducers and of signal processing techniques. However any experiment must have a reliable platform on which to develop these techniques. In my thesis work, I have designed, built, and tested a high-speed reconfigurable ultrasound beamforming platform.  
The complete receive beamformer system described in this thesis consists of hardware, firmware, and software components. All of these components work together to provide a platform for beamforming that is expandable, high-speed, and robust. The complexity of the operations being performed is hidden from the user by a simple to use and accessible software interface. 
Existing beamformer hardware is usually designed for real-time 2D image formation often using serial processing. The platform I built uses parallel processing in order to process ultrasound images 100 times faster than conventional systems. Conventional hardware is locked to a single or small number of similar transducers, while my design can be on-the-fly reprogrammed to work with nearly any transducer type. The system is also expandable to handle any size of device, while conventional systems can only handle a fixed number of device channels. The software I have created interfaces with the hardware and firmware components to provide an easy way to make use of the system’s reconfigurability. It also delivers a platform that can be simply expanded to host post-processing or signal analysis software to further fulfill a researcher’s needs.},

Our device sends and detects US waves through a random coding mask that enables unique signals at every voxel. Rotation of the mask allows for several compressed measurements.

Array apertures are synthesized using an active multi-element receive subaperture and a multi-element transmit subaperture defocused to emulate a single-element spatial response with high acoustic power. Echo signals are recorded independently by individual elements of the receive subaperture. Each method uses different spatial frequencies and acquisition strategies for imaging, and therefore different sets of active transmit/receive element combinations. Following acquisition, image points are reconstructed using the complete data set with full dynamic focus on both transmit and receive. Various factors affecting image quality have been evaluated and compared to conventional imagers through measurements with a 3.5 MHz, 128-element transducer array on different gel phantoms. Multielement synthetic aperture methods achieve higher electronic signal to noise ratio and better contrast resolution than conventional synthetic aperture techniques, approaching conventional phased array performance.{\textless} {\textgreater}},

Traditionally, low level analog signals are sent over long lines to the ultrasound instrument, which give rise to noise problems. In this work a different approach is followed by integrating in a single FPGA, digital processing functions together with an Ethernet link for several ultrasound channels. These functions include a set of digital signal processing functions to improve the information content of the output data stream: linear and non linear digital filtering, envelope extraction, multiple gates with programmable thresholds and data compression. Following the concept of system-on-a-chip, a processor is integrated in the FPGA. Although it is not involved in signal processing, it performs most of the internal and external communications and eases system upgrading. The Ethernet link implements the TCP/IP stack and allows networking for bidirectional communication with a host. Implementation in the FPGA hardware allows achieving high data rate transfers. Data packets are formatted in frames, which include information on status, position, peaks and processed data.},

The proposed architecture consists of 8 transmit channels and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based configurable delay profile to steer acoustic beam, transmit frequency and pulse pattern length depending on the medical application. Our system operates in pulse-echo mode, with ultrasound transmit frequency up to 20 MHz, excitation voltage up to 100 Vpp, and individual channel control with single high speed Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI). Pre-calculated delay profiles per scanline are generated in Matlab, based on physical parameters of 8 element linear transducer array which are used to steer and focus the ultrasound beam.

In addition, demand for the bone diagnostic is also increasing and due to that the idea to develop ultrasound circuit has emerged. The information regarding the ultrasound circuit has been studied as well as parameters related for bone density measurement. 1MHz frequency has the highest absorption for bone. The ultrasound circuit consists of a pulse generator system, high voltage pulse circuit, transducer for transmitter and receiver part, instrumentation amplifier and oscilloscope. The FPGA is chosen as a pulse generator and output from the FPGA is connected to MOSFET to create a pulse signal using a switching technique and enables voltage amplitude of the signal to be changed. The circuit was tested on human arm and heel to evaluate the signal strength with varying distance between the transducer and voltage signal amplitude.

The novelty of this paper is to describe the programming logic used for various types of interface scenarios from microcontroller to different programmable devices. The study presented describes the methods and logic flowcharts for different interfaces. The implementation of the interface logics were in prototype hardware for ultrasound scanner. The internal devices were controlled from the graphical user interface in a laptop and the scan results are taken.

Current capsule endoscopes are dependent on visual manifestation of disease and limited in regards to transmural imaging and detection of deeper pathology. Ultrasound capsule endoscopy (USCE) has the potential to overcome surface only imaging and provide transmural scans of the GI tract. The integration of high frequency microultrasound (µUS) into capsule endoscopy would allow high resolution transmural images and provide a means of both qualitative and quantitative assessment of the bowel wall. Quantitative ultrasound (QUS) can provide data in an objective and measurable manner, potentially reducing lengthy interpretation times by incorporation into an automated diagnostic process.

	abstract = {3D ultrasound (US) acquisition acquires volumetric images, thus alleviating a classical US imaging bottleneck that requires a highly-trained sonographer to operate the US probe. However, this opportunity has not been explored in practice, since 3D US machines are only suitable for hospital usage in terms of cost, size and power requirements. In this work we propose the first fully-digital, single-chip 3D US imager on FPGA. The proposed design is a complete processing pipeline that includes pre-processing, image reconstruction, and post-processing. It supports up to 1024 input channels, which matches or exceeds state of the art, in an unprecedented estimated power budget of 6.1 W. The imager exploits a highly scalable architecture which can be either downscaled for 2D imaging, or further upscaled on a larger FPGA. Our platform supports both real-time inputs over an optical cable, or test data feeds sent by a laptop running Matlab and custom tools over an Ethernet connection. Additionally, the design allows HDMI video output on a screen.},

	abstract = {Upcoming phased-array 2-D sensors will soon enable fast high-definition 3-D ultrasound imaging. Currently, the communication of raw radio-frequency (RF) channel data from the probe to the computer for digital beamforming is a bottleneck. For reducing the amount of transferred data samples, this paper investigates the design of an adapted sparse sampling technique for image reconstruction inspired by the compressed sensing framework. Echo responses from isolated points are generated using a physically based simulation of ultrasound wave propagation through tissues. These point spread functions form a dictionary of shift-variant bent waves, which depend on the specific sound excitation and acquisition protocols. Speckled ultrasound images can be approximately decomposed in this dictionary where sparsity is enforced at the system matrix design. The Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse is precomputed and used at the reconstruction stage for fast minimum-norm recovery from nonuniform pseudorandom sampled raw RF data. Results on simulated and acquired phantoms demonstrate the benefits of an optimized basis function design for high-quality B-mode image recovery from few RF channel data samples.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound image quality is often inherently limited by the physical dimensions of the imaging transducer. We hypothesize that, by collecting synthetic aperture data sets over a range of aperture positions while precisely tracking the position and orientation of the transducer, we can synthesize large effective apertures to produce images with improved resolution and target detectability. We analyze the two largest limiting factors for coherent signal summation: aberration and mechanical uncertainty. Using an excised canine abdominal wall as a model phase screen, we experimentally observed an effective arrival time error ranging from 18.3 ns to 58 ns (root-mean-square error) across the swept positions. Through this clutter-generating tissue, we observed a 72.9\% improvement in resolution with only a 3.75 dB increase in side lobe amplitude compared to the control case. We present a simulation model to study the effect of calibration and mechanical jitter errors on the synthesized point spread function. The relative effects of these errors in each imaging dimension are explored, showing the importance of orientation relative to the point spread function. We present a prototype device for performing swept synthetic aperture imaging using a conventional 1-D array transducer and ultrasound research scanner. Point target reconstruction error for a 44.2 degree sweep shows a reconstruction precision of 82.8 and 17.8 in the lateral and axial dimensions respectively, within the acceptable performance bounds of the simulation model. Improvements in resolution, contrast and contrast-to-noise ratio are demonstrated in vivo and in a fetal phantom.},

The proposed new method uses the same data acquisition scheme as the conventional focusing method while maintaining the same frame rate via high-speed signal processing, but it is not suitable for imaging moving objects. It improves upon the lateral resolution and sidelobe level at all imaging depths. Also, it increases the transmit power and image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), due to transmit field synthesis, and extends the image penetration depth as well. Evaluations with simulation and experimental data show much improvement in resolution and SNR at all imaging depths.},

	abstract = {Objective: In this paper, we present the design of low-cost medical ultrasound scanners aimed at the detection of maternal mortality risk factors in developing countries. Method: Modern ultrasound scanners typically employ a high element count transducer array with multichannel transmit and receive electronics. To minimize hardware costs, we employ a single piezoelectric element, mechanically swept across the target scene, and a highly cost-engineered single channel acquisition circuit. Given this constraint, we compare the achievable image quality of a monostatic fixed focus scanner (MFFS) with a monostatic synthetic aperture scanner (MSAS) using postfocusing. Quantitative analysis of image quality was carried out using simulation and phantom experiments, which were used to compare a proof-of-concept MSAS prototype with an MFFS device currently available on the market. Finally, in vivo experiments were performed to validate the MSAS prototype in obstetric imaging. Results: Simulations show that the achievable lateral resolution of the MSAS approach is superior at all ranges compared to the fixed focus approach. Phantom experiments verify the improved resolution of the MSAS prototype but reveal a lower signal to noise ratio. In vivo experiments show promising results using the MSAS for clinical diagnostics in prenatal care. Conclusion: The proposed MSAS achieves superior resolution but lower SNR compared to an MFFS approach, principally due to lower acoustic energy emitted. Significance : The production costs of the proposed MSAS could be an order of magnitude lower than any other ultrasound system on the market today, bringing affordable obstetric imaging a step closer for developing countries.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2013.0233},
	abstract = {In ultrasound medical imaging, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improvement can be achieved by utilizing the code excitation. To preserve the axial resolution, a pulse compression (PC) is performed by applying a matched filter based on the transmit code. However, the conventional PC method requires a few hundred filter coefficients when compressing elongated code (e.g., chirp) into a short pulse, yielding to considerably high computational complexity. In this paper, an efficient PC method of chirp coded excitation is proposed to lower the complexity burden. In the proposed method, the PC is conducted with the decimated complex baseband data instead of a beamformed radio-frequency (RF) data. Although compression is applied with the complex data, a total computational complexity is reduced by a factor of 4 L2 since L-fold decimation is performed to reduce both data and the number of filter coefficients. The proposed method was evaluated with the phantom study. For quantitative comparison, the -6dB axial resolution for 15 wire targets and the clutter-energy-to-total-energy ratios (CTRs) at a hypo-echoic region were measured. CTR were 27.6 dB and 27.4 dB for the conventional and proposed PC methods, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed method can maintain the performance of pulse compression of chirp coded excitation while substantially reducing computational complexity.},

In this paper, we propose a new dynamic CBB PC method ( that can improve the SNR while compensating for tissue attenuation. The compression filter coefficients in the method are generated by dynamically changing the demodulation frequencies along with the depth. For PC, the obtained coefficients are independently applied to the in-phase and quadrature components of the CBB data. To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, simulation, phantom, and in vivo studies were conducted, and all three studies showed improved SNR, i.e., maximally 3.87, 7.41, and 5.75 dB, respectively. In addition, the measured peak range sidelobe level of the proposed method yielded lower values than the and , and it also derived a suitable target location, i.e., a {\textless}0.07-mm target location error, while maintaining the axial resolution. In an in vivo abdominal experiment, the method depicted brighter and clearer features in the hyperechoic region because highly correlated signals were produced by compensating for tissue attenuation. These results demonstrated that the proposed method can improve the SNR of chirp-coded excitation while preserving the axial resolution and the target location and reducing the computational complexity.},

Second, most pipelines are implemented in special hardware, resulting in limited flexibility of implemented processing steps on such platforms. Methods: With SUPRA we propose an open-source pipeline for fully Software Defined Ultrasound Processing for Real-time Applications to alleviate these problems. Covering all steps from beamforming to output of B-mode images, SUPRA can help improve the reproducibility of results and make modifications to the image acquisition mode accessible to the research community. We evaluate the pipeline qualitatively, quantitatively, and regarding its run-time. Results: The pipeline shows image quality comparable to a clinical system and backed by point-spread function measurements a comparable resolution. Including all processing stages of a usual ultrasound pipeline, the run-time analysis shows that it can be executed in 2D and 3D on consumer GPUs in real-time. Conclusions: Our software ultrasound pipeline opens up the research in image acquisition. Given access to ultrasound data from early stages (raw channel data, radiofrequency data) it simplifies the development in imaging. Furthermore, it tackles the reproducibility of research results, as code can be shared easily and even be executed without dedicated ultrasound hardware.},

Development of microbubble contrast agents over the past several decades has enabled ultrasound to distinguish between blood flow and surrounding tissue. Current clinical practices using microbubble contrast agents rely heavily on user training to evaluate degree of localized perfusion. Advances in separating the signals produced from contrast agents versus surrounding tissue backscatter provide unique opportunities for specialized sensors designed to image microbubbles with higher signal to noise and resolution than previously possible. In this review article, we describe the background principles and recent developments of ultrasound transducer technology for receiving signals produced by contrast agents while rejecting signals arising from soft tissue. This approach relies on transmitting at a  low-frequency and receiving microbubble harmonic signals at frequencies many times higher than the transmitted frequency. Design and fabrication of dual-frequency transducers and the extension of recent developments in transducer technology for dual-frequency harmonic imaging are discussed.},

In this paper, we present three significant extensions to improve the performance of the basic method. First, we investigate the effect of varying the size and shape of the sticks. We show that these variations affect the performance of the algorithm in very fundamental ways, for example by making it more or less sensitive to thinner or more tightly curving boundaries. Second, we present a means of improving the performance of this technique by estimating the distribution function of the orientation of the line passing through each point. Finally, we show that images can be "stained" for easier visual interpretation by applying to each pixel a false color whose hue is related to the orientation of the most prominent line segment at that point. Examples are given to illustrate the performance of the different settings on a single image.},

However, the computer software that helps design and execute experiments and analyze data has an additional source: It can also be free and open-source software (FOSS) (1). FOSS has the advantage that the code is openly available for modification and is also often free of charge. In the past, customizing software has been much easier than custom-building equipment, which often can be quite costly because fabrication requires the skills of machinists, glassblowers, technicians, or outside suppliers. However, the open-source paradigm is now enabling creation of open-source scientific hardware by combining three-dimensional (3D) printing with open-source microcontrollers running on FOSS. These developments are illustrated below by several examples of equipment fabrication that can better meet particular specifications at substantially lower overall costs.
A rapidly increasing selection of laboratory equipment can be fabricated with open-source three-dimensional printers at low cost.

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.2007.165},
	abstract = {Synthetic aperture (SA) ultrasound imaging has many advantages in terms of flexibility and accuracy. One of the major drawbacks is, however, that no system exists, which can implement SA imaging in real time due to the very high number of calculations amounting to roughly 1 billion complex focused samples per second per receive channel. Real time imaging is a key aspect in ultrasound, and to truly demonstrate the many advantages of SA imaging, a system usable in the clinic should be made. The paper describes a system capable of real time SA B-mode and vector flow imaging. The synthetic aperture real-time ultrasound system (SARUS) has been developed through the last 2 years and can perform real time SA imaging and storage of RF channel data for multiple seconds. SARUS consists of a 1024 channel analog front-end and 64 identical digital boards. Each has 16 transmit channels and 16 receive channels both with a sampling frequency of 70 MHz/12 bits for arbitrary waveform emission and reception. The board holds live Virtex 4FX100 FPGAs, where one houses a PowerPC CPU used for control. The remaining four are used for generation of transmit signals, receive storage and matched Alter processing, and focusing and summing of data. Each FPGA can perform 80 billion multiplications/s and the full system can perform 25,600 billion multiplications/s. The FPGAs are connected through multiple 3.2 Gbit Rocket IO links, which makes it possible to send more than 1.6 GBytes/s of data between the FPGAs and between boards. The system can concurrently sample in 1024 channels, thus, generating 140 GBytes/s of data, which also can be processed in real time or stored. The system is controlled over a 1 Gbit/s Ethernet link to each digital board that runs Linux. The control and processing are divided into functional units that are accessed through an IP numbering scheme in a hierarchical order. A single controlling mechanism can, thus, be used to access the whole system from any PC. It is also p-
ossible for the controlling PowerPCs to access all other boards, which enables advanced adaptive imaging. The software is written in C++ and runs under Matlab for high level access to the system in a command structure similar to the Field II simulation program. This makes it possible for the user to specify imaging in very few lines of code and the set-up is fast due to the employment of the 64 PowerPCs in parallel. Focusing is done using a parametric beam former. Code synthesized for a Xilinx V4FX100 speed grade 11 FPGA can operate at a maximum clock frequency of 167.8 MHz producing 1 billion I and Q samples/second sufficient for real time SA imaging. The system is currently in production, and all boards have been laid out. VHDL and C++ code for the control has been written and the code for real time beamformation has been made and has obtained a sufficient performance for real-time imaging.},

	doi = {10.1109/ULTSYM.1999.849300},
	abstract = {Digital signal processing is being employed more and more in modern ultrasound scanners. This has made it possible to do dynamic receive focusing for each sample and implement other advanced imaging methods. The processing, however, has to be very fast and cost-effective at the same time. Dedicated chips are used in order to do real time processing. This often makes it difficult to implement radically different imaging strategies on one platform and makes the scanners less accessible for research purposes. Here flexibility is the prime concern, and the storage of data from all transducer elements over 5 to 10 seconds is needed to perform clinical evaluation of synthetic and 3D imaging. This paper describes a real-time system specifically designed for research purposes. The purpose of the system is to make it possible to acquire multi-channel data in real-time from clinical multi-element ultrasound transducers, and to enable real-time or near real-time processing of the acquired data. The system will be capable of performing the processing for the currently available imaging methods, and will make it possible to perform initial trials in a clinical environment with new imaging modalities for synthetic aperture imaging, 2D and 3D B-mode and velocity imaging. The system can be used with 128 element transducers and can excite 128 channels and receive and sample data from 64 channels simultaneously at 40 MHz with 12 bits precision. Data can be processed in real time using the system's 80 signal processing units or it can be stored directly in RAM. The system has 24 GBytes RAM and can thus store 8 seconds of multi-channel data. It is fully software programmable and its signal processing units can also be reconfigured under software control. The control of the system is done over an Ethernet using C and Matlab. Programs for doing, e.g. B-mode imaging can directly be written in Matlab and executed on the system over the net from any workstation running Matlab. The overall system concept is presented and an example of a 20 lines script for doing phased array B-mode imaging is presented},

	abstract = {Clinical endoscopy and colonoscopy are commonly used to investigate and diagnose disorders in the upper gastrointestinal tract and colon respectively. However, examination of the anatomically remote small bowel with conventional endoscopy is challenging. This and advances in miniaturization led to the development of video capsule endoscopy (VCE) to allow small bowel examination in a non-invasive manner. Available since 2001, current capsule endoscopes are limited to viewing the mucosal surface only due to their reliance on optical imaging. To overcome this limitation with submucosal imaging, work is under way to implement microultrasound (μUS) imaging in the same form as VCE devices. This paper describes two prototype capsules, termed Sonocap and Thermocap, which were developed respectively to assess the quality of μUS imaging and the maximum power consumption that can be tolerated for such a system. The capsules were tested in vivo in the oesophagus and small bowel of porcine models. Results are presented in the form of μUS B-scans and safe temperature readings observed up to 100 mW in both biological regions. These results demonstrate that acoustic coupling and μUS imaging can be achieved in vivo in the lumen of the bowel and the maximum power consumption that is possible for miniature μUS systems.},

Utilizing the previously-developed efficient front-end algorithms and the continuing advances in solid state devices, we developed a hybrid programmable architecture to support core ultrasound signal processing. With the advent of new- generation digital signal processors (DSPs) (e.g., Texas Instruments' TMS320C6455 and IBM's Cell Broadband Engine), this hybrid field programmable gate array (FPGA)- DSP architecture can evolve towards a single-chip solution after overcoming the following challenges: (a) inefficient data access during dynamic focusing and (b) multiple, parallel data- transfer paths from ADCs. In this paper, we present a new single-DSP architecture, where an advanced DSP handles all the front- and back-end processing in software. To enable this new architecture, we have (a) developed a new stepwise dynamic focusing method, where the same delay curve is utilized for a group of samples along the depth direction and (b) investigated use of serial interfaces for ADC to DSP data transfer. It was found that the TMS320C6455 can meet the requirements of a 32-channel B-mode imaging system using 56.6\% and 85.4\% of the computing and serial I/O resources of the DSP, respectively. These results indicate that a single DSP chip solution can meet the hardware requirements for lower-end medical ultrasound systems.},

	abstract = {A wide variety of beamforming approaches are applied in modern ultrasound scanners, ranging from optimal time domain beamforming strategies at one end to rudimentary narrowband schemes at the other. Although significant research has been devoted to improving image quality, usually at the expense of beamformer complexity, we are interested in investigating strategies that sacrifice some image quality in exchange for reduced cost and ease in implementation. This paper describes the direct sampled in-phase/quadrature (DSIQ) beamformer, which is one such low-cost, extremely simple, and compact approach. DSIQ beamforming relies on phase rotation of I/Q data to implement focusing. The I/Q data are generated by directly sampling the received radio frequency (RF) signal, rather than through conventional demodulation. We describe an efficient hardware implementation of the beam-former, which results in significant reductions in beam-former size and cost. We present the results of simulations and experiments that compare the DSIQ beamformer to more conventional approaches, namely, time delay beamforming and traditional complex demodulated I/Q beam-forming. Results that show the effect of an error in the direct sampling process, as well as dependence on signal bandwidth and system f number (f\#) are also presented. These results indicate that the image quality and robustness of the DSIQ beamformer are adequate for low end scanners. We also describe implementation of the DSIQ beamformer in an inexpensive hand-held ultrasound system being developed in our laboratory.},

Integration of capacitive micromachined ultrasonic transducer (CMUT) arrays with front-end electronics in single-chip configuration allows for implementation of such catheter probes with reduced interconnect complexity, miniaturization, and high mechanical flexibility. We implemented a single-chip forward-looking (FL) ultrasound imaging system by fabricating a 1.4-mm-diameter dual-ring CMUT array using CMUT-on-CMOS technology on a front-end IC implemented in 0.35-μm CMOS process. The dual-ring array has 56 transmit elements and 48 receive elements on two separate concentric annular rings. The IC incorporates a 25-V pulser for each transmitter and a low-noise capacitive transimpedance amplifier (TIA) for each receiver, along with digital control and smart power management. The final shape of the silicon chip is a 1.5-mm-diameter donut with a 430-μm center hole for a guide wire. The overall front-end system requires only 13 external connections and provides 4 parallel RF outputs while consuming an average power of 20 mW. We measured RF A-scans from the integrated single- chip array which show full functionality at 20.1 MHz with 43\% fractional bandwidth. We also tested and demonstrated the image quality of the system on a wire phantom and an ex vivo chicken heart sample. The measured axial and lateral point resolutions are 92 μm and 251 μm, respectively. We successfully acquired volumetric imaging data from the ex vivo chicken heart at 60 frames per second without any signal averaging. These demonstrative results indicate that single-chip CMUT-on-CMOS systems have the potential to produce realtime volumetric images with image- quality and speed suitable for catheter-based clinical applications.},

With its better image quality and ease of use, ICE is becoming the preferred imaging modality over transesophageal echography (TEE) for structural heart interventions. The existing commercial ICE catheters, however, offer a limited 2-D or 3-D field of view despite catheters utilizing large number of wires. In these catheters, each element in the ICE array is connected to the backend data-acquisition channel with a separate wire, which is a critical barrier for improving image quality and widening the field of view. In order to use ICE catheters under MRI instead of the ionizing X-ray radiation-based angiography, the number of interconnect wires in the catheter should be minimized to reduce RF-induced heating. Furthermore, reducing the number of wires improves the flexibility and lowers the cost of the single-use ICE catheters.},

This paper proposes a method for the measurement of channel source impedance (transducer, coaxial cable and T/R switch) through the use of an integrated receiver analogue front end with configurable termination resistance. The proposed method is first demonstrated using a pitch-catch configuration using a separate source transducer to excite the transducer under test. Subsequently the method is demonstrated the Ultrasound Array Research Platform (UARP) and a linear array transducer in a pulse echo mode where the transducer impedance is determined through the analysis of two ultrasound echoes. The proposed method is especially suited to rapid transducer testing in the field, such as in a hospital, or where access to the transducer is not possible as in many industrial processes.},

A laboratory model of the focusing system based on time reversal is developed and manufactured. One of the principal elements of the system is a reverberator with several piezoelectric transducers attached to its walls. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the ability of such a system to generate one focus or several foci and to steer them electronically at considerable distances (50 mm at minimum) off the axis of the focusing system without causing the appearance of any grating lobes or other secondary intensity maxima. The focusing properties of the system are compared with the results of numerical simulation of two-dimensional phased arrays, whose parameters are taken to be typical for the arrays used in extracorporeal surgery. The important role of randomization is demonstrated for both of the aforementioned focusing methods. The prospects of practical application of the two methods are discussed.},

	url = {http://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/14035},
	abstract = {Long Range Ultrasonic Testing (LRUT) is an emerging ultrasound Non-destructive Testing (NDT) method. The LRUT is a variant of the conventional NDT approach. By using ultrasound guided waves (UGWs) , it is efficient in quick long range defect scanning, which is impossible with other traditional NDT techniques. Increasing numbers of requirements for quick long range testing have led to urgent need for the improvement of testing methods and the development of new testing equipment to help researchers in laboratory and help technicians in  field inspection. The market for multi-channel ultrasonic instruments is characterized by small volumes of sales and a high ratio of development costs to sale price. The consequence is that the investment required to develop an instrument is significant and upgrades and other changes to instrument specification or configuration are difficult for many manufacturers to justify. These factors are particularly relevant for long range guided wave technology, where the technology is still relatively new in the market place and the instrumentation has different characteristics from other type of ultrasonic systems. In order to support the design and manufacture of the Teletest®MK4 system, Plant Integrity Ltd has supported this study into the use of a  field-programmable gates array (FPGA) based control circuits for the electronics, which allows the component count to be decreased and also permits the system to be modified via flexible reconfiguration of the FPGA. This has benefits of reduction of size, weight and power consumption of the electronics and provides a means of upgrading the product without expensive re-design of the hardware. FPGA device has been the enabling technology and main thrust behind the evolution of many technologies, unleashing new opportunities for improving the performance of the LRUT equipment and providing more functions for industrial and academic applications. A novel system has been developed to provide multichannel waveform generation, data capture and signal processing for advanced lab-based research and faster- field testing. This system includes an FPGA to process multichannel data in parallel and to provide the flexibility of reconfiguration for various testing applications proposed by new research. The design was tested in pre-prototype hardware. Subsequent construction of the commercial prototype unit enabled successful operation of the design to be demonstrated. Implementation of the FPGA design reduced component count, PCB dimensions and power consumption. Though the SpartanTM 3A DSP FPGA and Xilinx ISE software have been used in this project, the concepts of the design can be applied to other FPGA devices from other FPGA vendors using other design softwares.},

However, most implementations developed to take advantage of this framework revolve around controlling the measurements with carefully engineered material or acquisition sequences. Instead, we use the natural randomness of wave propagation through multiply scattering media as an optimal and instantaneous compressive imaging mechanism. Waves reflected from an object are detected after propagation through a well-characterized complex medium. Each local measurement thus contains global information about the object, yielding a purely analog compressive sensing method. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for optical imaging by using a 300-micrometer thick layer of white paint as the compressive imaging device. Scattering media are thus promising candidates for designing efficient and compact compressive imagers.},

Thousands of transducers are typically needed for focusing and steering in a 3-D volume. In this article, we propose a different concept allowing us to obtain electronic 3-D focusing with a small number of transducers. The basic idea is to couple a small number of transducers to a chaotic reverberating cavity with one face in contact with the body of the patient. The reverberations of the ultrasonic waves inside the cavity create at each reflection virtual transducers. The cavity acts as an ultrasonic kaleidoscope multiplying the small number of transducers and creating a much larger virtual transducer array. By exploiting time-reversal processing, it is possible to use collectively all the virtual transducers to focus a pulse everywhere in a 3-D volume. The reception process is based on a nonlinear pulse-inversion technique in order to ensure a good contrast. The feasibility of this concept for the building of 3-D images was demonstrated using a prototype relying only 31 emission transducers and a single reception transducer.},

Greedy algorithms have been found to be more suitable in hardware solutions, however they rely on efficient matrix inversion techniques in order to solve the underdetermined linear systems involved. In this paper, a novel and efficient FPGA architecture to find a matrix inversion is presented.

The received data can be accessed as single element channel data and transferred to a PC via Gigabit Ethernet or PCI-Express where beamforming can be done on a graphics processor (GPU). Powerful online and offline software packages including unique filtering interfaces and closed-loop control are available to process, analyze and visualize the data.

METHODS: B-scan images produced using two transducers, one with a narrow bandwidth and the other with a broad bandwidth, both having nominal center frequencies of 10 MHz, were evaluated. Comparative scans were made of a tissue-mimicking phantom, an intraocular tumor, and a vitreous hemorrhage.
RESULTS: Results showed that broadband transducers gave improved resolution and finer speckle texture, but had lower sensitivity. Broadband transducers were most suitable for situations in which resolution was more important than sensitivity, such as imaging of tumors. The greater sensitivity of the narrowband probe made it most useful for evaluation of vitreous complications, such as hemorrhage and membranes.
CONCLUSION: In addition to transducer frequency, bandwidth should be taken into account when choosing a transducer for a specific ophthalmic imaging application. Both broad- and narrowband transducers have relative advantages in particular applications.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Commercial ultrasound machines in the past did not provide the ultrasound researchers access to raw ultrasound data. Lack of this ability has impeded evaluation and clinical testing of novel ultrasound algorithms and applications.
OBJECTIVES: Recently, we developed a flexible ultrasound back-end where all the processing for the conventional ultrasound modes, such as B, M, color flow and spectral Doppler, was performed in software. The back-end has been incorporated into a commercial ultrasound machine, the Hitachi HiVision 5500. The goal of this work is to develop an ultrasound research interface on the back-end for acquiring raw ultrasound data from the machine.
METHODS: The research interface has been designed as a software module on the ultrasound back-end. To increase the amount of raw ultrasound data that can be spooled in the limited memory available on the back-end, we have developed a method that can losslessly compress the ultrasound data in real time.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The raw ultrasound data could be obtained in any conventional ultrasound mode, including duplex and triplex modes. Furthermore, use of the research interface does not decrease the frame rate or otherwise affect the clinical usability of the machine. The lossless compression of the ultrasound data in real time can increase the amount of data spooled by approximately 2.3 times, thus allowing more than 6s of raw ultrasound data to be acquired in all the modes. The interface has been used not only for early testing of new ideas with in vitro data from phantoms, but also for acquiring in vivo data for fine-tuning ultrasound applications and conducting clinical studies. We present several examples of how newer ultrasound applications, such as elastography, vibration imaging and 3D imaging, have benefited from this research interface. Since the research interface is entirely implemented in software, it can be deployed on existing HiVision 5500 ultrasound machines and may be easily upgraded in the future.
CONCLUSIONS: The developed research interface can aid researchers in the rapid testing and clinical evaluation of new ultrasound algorithms and applications. Additionally, we believe that our approach would be applicable to designing research interfaces on other ultrasound machines.},

This paper presents the development of a real-time compact and open system for customized ultrasound bio-microscope studies. The system design was based on high speed FPGA embedded in compact printed circuit board (PCB) to achieve B-mode imaging and pulsed-wave (PW) Doppler imaging. Instead of hardware circuitries, most of functions were achieved with FPGA programs such as filter, envelope detector, digital scan converter (DSC), and complex fast Fourier transform (CFFT). The system structure could easily be modified by the user for customized applications. Testing results showed that the system could offer a minimum detectable signal of 25μV, allowing a 51dB dynamic range at 47dB gain. PCI interface included in the system allowed fast radio frequency (RF) data transfer and real-time imaging (over 500 frames per second). Phantom and in vivo imaging experiments were conducted and results showed good performance of system.},

	abstract = {Fast diagnosis plays a crucial role in treating the patients, which can be life saving manytimes. Ultrasound scanning have the capability to image the organs in real time, thus offering quick diagnosis. Recent advancements in computing platforms greatly reduced the size of an ultrasound machine to portable level. Portable ultrasound machines can be used for point of care and remote diagnosis, this comforts the patients by making them not going to the ultrasound scanner for diagnosis. Diagnosing the patients at their bedside reduces the diagnosis and medication time. Lack of sonographers limits the benefits of using portable ultrasound machines in remote diagnosis. Tele-radiology can be effectively used as a solution to provide better health-care to more number of patients with less number of experts. Portable ultrasound in remote diagnosis is concerned with wireless connectivity for web-based diagnosis, security, data aggregation of patients etc., In this paper, we propose a working prototype of portable ultrasound scanning system integrated with wireless connectivity, biometric authentication, Global Positioning System (GPS). Additional interfaces to the portable ultrasound system enables secured cloud based diagnosis, improving the health-care and reducing the geographical separation between patients and doctors.},

The backend processing consists of envelope detection which uses fixed filter coefficients for Hilbert transformation, log compression technique to achieve the desired dynamic range for display and image enhancement technique to increase the contrast. In-phase and quadrature phase components are computed using envelope detection block, whose absolute value is compressed to fit the dynamic range of display and interpolated to avoid artifacts while displaying. Further full scale contrast stretch enhancement technique is used to improve the image clarity. The implementation of the backend algorithms along with image enhancement technique on FPGA, show that the resolution of display is improved and also the hardware resource utilization is minimized leading to compact design for portable ultrasound systems.},

	abstract = {Received echo signals of transducer in ultrasound imaging have a high dynamic range of 12 bits and hence cannot be displayed on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) monitors of ultrasound machine. Log compression is being used to compress the data to 8 bits. Since log compression is a non linear compression it is very difficult to trace the original characteristics of the signal. In this paper various global and local compression techniques were studied as a replacement for log compression so that the dynamic range of image can be retrieved if the physician has a better monitor for display, and also ensure minimum error in the retrieved signal leading to minimum error in retrieved image. From the results it is observed that Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) of wavelet compressed image is 1.02 times more and that of gamma compressed image is 2.24 times more than log compressed image. Gamma based compression can be preferred to log and wavelet based compression, as it gives good quality image when compared with other compression techniques, but cannot be used to retrieve the statistical properties when expanded, since these statistical properties are helpful for doctors for better analysis. Wavelet based compression serves this purpose and hence is best suited for Internet of Things (IoT) enabled ultrasound system for remote diagnosis in the cloud.},

	abstract = {Open platform (OP) ultrasound systems are aimed primarily at the research community. They have been at the forefront of the development of synthetic aperture, plane wave, shear wave elastography, and vector flow imaging. Such platforms are driven by a need for broad flexibility of parameters that are normally preset or fixed within clinical scanners. OP ultrasound scanners are defined to have three key features including customization of the transmit waveform, access to the prebeamformed receive data, and the ability to implement real-time imaging. In this paper, a formative discussion is given on the development of OPs from both the research community and the commercial sector. Both software- and hardware-based architectures are considered, and their specifications are compared in terms of resources and programmability. Software-based platforms capable of real-time beamforming generally make use of scalable graphics processing unit architectures, whereas a common feature of hardware-based platforms is the use of field-programmable gate array and digital signal processor devices to provide additional on-board processing capacity. OPs with extended number of channels ({\textgreater}256) are also discussed in relation to their role in supporting 3-D imaging technique development. With the increasing maturity of OP ultrasound scanners, the pace of advancement in ultrasound imaging algorithms is poised to be accelerated.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging of deep targets is limited by the resolution of current ultrasound systems based on the available aperture size. We propose a system to synthesize an extended effective aperture in order to improve resolution and target detectability at depth using a precisely-tracked transducer swept across the region of interest. A Field II simulation was performed to demonstrate the swept aperture approach in both the spatial and frequency domains. The adaptively beam-formed system was tested experimentally using a volumetric transducer and an ex vivo canine abdominal layer to evaluate the impact of clutter-generating tissue on the resulting point spread function. Resolution was improved by 73\% using a 30.8 degree sweep despite the presence of varying aberration across the array with an amplitude on the order of 100 ns. Slight variations were observed in the magnitude and position of side lobes compared to the control case, but overall image quality was not significantly degraded as compared by a simulation based on the experimental point spread function. We conclude that the swept aperture imaging system may be a valuable tool for synthesizing large effective apertures using conventional ultrasound hardware. © COPYRIGHT SPIE.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional ultrasound is emerging as an important adjunct to conventional 2D scanning, in particular in obstetrics and cardiology. Three-dimensional ultrasound makes it easier to visualize objects, pathologies and injuries. Three-dimensional ultrasound may be implemented in form of free hand scanning, which can be augmented with a registration system that records the position and orientation of each scan plane. The registration system may be in the form of an optical or EM source, mounted on the transducer, and with corresponding sensors placed in the room. In terms of portable ultrasound, free hand scanning is the most practical way to acquire 3D images. In this paper we present a new and very compact type of optical registration system, which tracks the position of the transducer on the skin surface. This is done continuously by acquiring images of the skin at the transducer location with a CCD-array, attached on the side of the transducer. With this position information, a sequence of 2D ultrasound frames, obtained with freehand scanning and thus likely to have unequal spacing and varying lateral position, is interpolated into a sequence of ultrasound frames with equal spacing and fixed lateral position. The implementation uses the Terason ultrasound scanner [1] and Sonocubic 3D software, operating in Windows XP. To validate the registration method, a phantom with a rod-shaped inclusion was scanned in an uneven scan path. Five scans were made of a known volume. The volume estimations, based on the interpolated scan planes, fell within 96-106\% of the actual volume, with a mean around 101\%. Thus, we have demonstrated that the compensation algorithm is working as expected.},

	abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is a ubiquitous diagnostic technique, but does not fit the requirements of the telemedicine approach, because it relies on the real-time manipulation and image recognition skills of a trained expert, called sonographer. Sonographers are only available in hospitals and clinics, negating or at least delaying access to ultrasound scans in many locales—rural areas, developing countries—as well as in medical rescue operations. Telesonography would require an advanced imager that supports three-dimensional (3-D) acquisition; this would allow untrained operators to acquire broad scans and upload them remotely for diagnosis. Such advanced imagers do exist, but do not meet several other requirements for telesonography, such as being portable, inexpensive, and sufficiently low power to enable battery operation. In this work, we present our prototype of the first portable 3-D digital ultrasound back-end system. The prototype is implemented in a single midrange Xilinx field programmable gate array (FPGA), for an estimated power consumption of 5 W. The device supports up to 1024 input channels, which is state of the art and could be scaled further, and supports multiple image reconstruction modes. We evaluate the resource utilization of the FPGA and provide various quality metrics to ascertain the output image quality.},

	abstract = {Wirelessly networked systems of implantable medical devices endowed with sensors and actuators will be the basis of many innovative, sometimes revolutionary therapies. The biggest obstacle in realizing this vision of networked implantable devices is posed by the dielectric nature of the human body, which strongly attenuates radio-frequency (RF) electromagnetic waves. In this paper we present the first hardware and software architecture of an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) platform with ultrasonic connectivity for intra-body communications that can be used as a basis for building future IoT-ready medical implantable and wearable devices. We show that ultrasonic waves can be efficiently generated and received with low-power and mm-sized components, and that despite the conversion loss introduced by ultrasonic transducers the gap in attenuation between 2.4 GHz RF and ultrasonic waves is still substantial, e.g., ultrasounds offer 70 dB less attenuation over 10 cm. We show that the proposed IoMT platform requires much lower transmission power compared to 2.4 GHz RF with equal reliability in tissues, e.g., 35 dBm lower over 12 cm for 10$^{\textrm{-3}}$ Bit Error Rate (BEr) leading to lower energy per bit and longer device lifetime. Finally, we show experimentally that 2.4 GHz RF links are not functional at all above 12 cm, while ultrasonic links achieve a reliability of 10$^{\textrm{-6}}$ up to 20 cm with less than 0 dBm transmission power.},

The method can achieve resolutions well beyond the diffraction limit, which is set by the excitation signal wavelength and numerical aperture of the imaging system. The fundamental principle that underlies this model based imaging technique is the preservation of the spatial frequency information content of the recorded echo signals with the help of pseudo-random apodization function followed by summation. A Verasonics V1 ultrasonic scanner is used to conduct experiments using an anechoic cyst made from gel phantom, immersed in degassed water. The estimated images were compared to those obtained using traditional B-mode delay-and-sum imaging available with the Verasonics V1 ultrasound machine. The estimated images using the proposed imaging technique showed a contrast ratio of 0.96 and Full-Width-Half-Maximum (FWHM) of about half the wavelength at a depth of 9.1 cm and at 1.875 MHz center frequency while the traditional delay and sum images had a contrast ratio of 0.62 and FWHM of about 5.5 wavelengths.},

The usability of the device and its accuracy, with respect to the reference ultrasound imaging system, was verified by conducting in-vivo measurements on 30 subjects. Stiffness measurements made using ARTSENS in sitting posture showed strong correlation with those obtained from the imaging system in supine posture.

Micro-ultrasound is one of these tools and is second after whole-mouse fluorescence or bioluminescent imaging, in terms of installed systems. We report in this paper the first commercially available array transducer–based ultrasound imaging system that enables micro-ultrasound imaging at center frequencies between 15 and 50MHz. At the heart of the new scanner is a laser-machined high-frequency 256 element, linear transducer array capable of forming dynamic diffraction limited beams. The power of the linear array approach is embodied in the uniform high resolution maintained over the full field of view. This leads to greatly expanded scope for real-time functional imaging that is demonstrated in this paper. The unprecedented images made with the new imaging system will enable many new applications not previously possible. These include real-time visualization of flow in the mouse placenta, visualization of flow development in the embryo, studies of embryonic to adult cardiac development/disease, and studies of real-time blood flow in mouse models of tumour angiogenesis.

	abstract = {The lack of open access to the pre-beamformed data of an ultrasound scanner has limited the research of novel imaging methods to a few privileged laboratories. To address this need, we have developed a pre-beamformed data acquisition (DAQ) system that can collect data over 128 array elements in parallel from the Ultrasonix series of research-purpose ultrasound scanners. Our DAQ system comprises three system-level blocks: 1) a connector board that interfaces with the array probe and the scanner through a probe connector port; 2) a main board that triggers DAQ and controls data transfer to a computer; and 3) four receiver boards that are each responsible for acquiring 32 channels of digitized raw data and storing them to the on-board memory. This system can acquire pre-beamformed data with 12-bit resolution when using a 40-MHz sampling rate. It houses a 16 GB RAM buffer that is sufficient to store 128 channels of pre-beamformed data for 8000 to 25000 transmit firings, depending on imaging depth; corresponding to nearly a 2-s period in typical imaging setups. Following the acquisition, the data can be transferred through a USB 2.0 link to a computer for offline processing and analysis. To evaluate the feasibility of using the DAQ system for advanced imaging research, two proof-of-concept investigations have been conducted on beamforming and plane-wave B-flow imaging. Results show that adaptive beamforming algorithms such as the minimum variance approach can generate sharper images of a wire cross-section whose diameter is equal to the imaging wavelength (150 μm in our example). Also, plane wave B-flow imaging can provide more consistent visualization of blood speckle movement given the higher temporal resolution of this imaging approach (2500 fps in our example).},

This paper reports the design and testing of a 64 channel digital imaging system which consists of an analog front-end pulser/receiver, 64 channels of Time-Gain Compensation (TGC), 64 channels of high-speed digitizer as well as a beamformer. A Personal Computer (PC) is used as the user interface to display real-time images. This system is designed as a platform for the purpose of testing the performance of high frequency linear arrays that have been developed in house. Therefore conventional approaches were taken it its implementation. Flexibility and ease of use are of primary concern whereas consideration of cost-effectiveness and novelty in design are only secondary. Even so, there are many issues at higher frequencies but do not exist at lower frequencies need to be solved. The system provides 64 channels of excitation pulsers while receiving simultaneously at a 20–120MHz sampling rate to 12-bits. The digitized data from all channels are first fed through Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), and then stored in memories. These raw data are accessed by the beamforming processor to re-build the image or to be downloaded to the PC for further processing. The beamformer that applies delays to the echoes of each channel is implemented with the strategy that combines coarse (8.3ns) and fine delays (2ns). The coarse delays are integer multiples of the sampling clock rate and are achieved by controlling the write enable pin of the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) memory to obtain valid beamforming data. The fine delays are accomplished with interpolation filters. This system is capable of achieving a maximum frame rate of 50 frames per second. Wire phantom images acquired with this system show a spatial resolution of 146μm (lateral) and 54μm (axial). Images with excised rabbit and pig eyeball as well as mouse embryo were also acquired to demonstrate its imaging capability.},

Unlike other modalities, ultrasound transducers require little power, which makes handheld imaging platforms possible, and several low-resolution 2D devices are commercially available today. However, the extreme computational requirements (and associated power requirements) of 3D ultrasound image formation have, to date, precluded handheld 3D-capable devices. The authors describe the Sonic Millip3De, a new system architecture and accelerator for 3D ultrasound beamforming--the most computationally intensive aspect of image formation. Their three-layer die-stacked design combines a new approach to the ultrasound imaging algorithm better suited to hardware with a custom beamforming accelerator that employs massive data parallelism and a streaming pipeline architecture to achieve high-quality 3D ultrasound imaging within a full-system power of 15 W in 45-nm semiconductor technology (400\&\#x00D7; less than a conventional DSP solution). Under anticipated scaling trends, the authors project that Sonic Millip3De will achieve the target 5-W power budget by the 16-nm technology node.},

The design is scalable; a configuration supporting a 32×32-channel probe, which enables high-quality imaging, consumes only about 5W.},

Our imaging setup is based around a single imaging and sensing element travelling along the perimeter of a circular domain. A 2D reflectivity field of the interior of the domain is recovered based on back-scattered echoes recorded at a large number of element positions. To obtain high-quality images, we suggest a simple new approach to resolve the angular ambiguity inherent to ultrasound measurements based on circular wave-fronts. The analysis incorporates observations obtained at several adjacent positions of a sensing elements. The method is validated using simulated and real data of a human limb. The validation shows improvement of the image quality compared to the classical image reconstruction algorithm for such setups.},

	abstract = {Ceramic ultrasonic transducers with a frequency response \&lt;50MHz using lead zirconate titanate (PZT) layers in the 5-4Otm range have been difficult to achieve by bulk or thin film techniques. Advances in the production of small sized PZT ceramic powder allow the development ofthinner ceramic layers for this application. Sol gel composite thin film technology also provides a new technique for producing ceramic coatings of a thickness that successfully bridges the gap between traditional thin film and bulk techniques. So! gel composite PZT layers of 5-7Om have been coated on substrates (aluminum, platinized silicon, stainless steel, .. .) that can withstand the thermal processing of the ceramic. The thickness mode response of a thin piezoelectric layer supported by a thick substrate has been modeled from first principles using complex material constants. The LevenbergMarquart non linear regression technique has been used to extract the thickness mode elastic stiffness, dielectric constant and piezoelectric constant of the PZT, and the elastic stiffness of the substrate from the layered structure. This non-destructive technique allows for a reliable assessment of the quality of a coating prior to the fabrication of a transducer. The elastic stiffness of the substrate is not lossy enough for the required broadband response of an imaging transducer. However, aluminum can be preferentially etched, releasing the ceramic coating. Therefore it is possible to transfer the PZT film to a more suitable backing material. A processing sequence for single element PZT transducers in the frequency range of 50-200MHz has been developed. Characterization of transducers has been performed using pulse-echo techniques and by creating real time B-scan images of agar phantoms and biological tissue. Methods for patterning the PZT composite coatings are being developed with the intent to fabricate a linear array in the 40-60 MHz frequency range. Due to the very fine patterning and high concentration of cuts required for a high aspect ratio linear array, the limits of conventional etching techniques are surpassed. Laser micromachining using a frequency doubled Nd:YAG and a KrF excimer laser have the ability to pattern the array structure. In both cases, laser cuts \&lt;1Om wide have been achieved.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, substantial effort has been directed toward developing ultrasonic systems for medical imaging. With advances in computational power, previously theorized scanning methods such as ultrasound tomography can now be realized. This thesis presents the design, error analysis, and initial image reconstructions from a single element 3D ultrasound tomography system. The system enables volumetric pulse echo or transmission imaging of distal limbs, for applications including: improving prosthetic fittings, monitoring bone density, and characterizing muscle health. The system is designed as a flexible mechanical platform for iterative development of algorithms targeting imaging of soft tissue with bone. The mechanical system independently controls movement of two single element ultrasound transducers in a cylindrical water tank. Each transducer can independently circle about the center of the tank as well as move vertically in depth. High resolution positioning feedback ({\textasciitilde}1[mu]m) and control enables flexible positioning of the transmitter and the receiver around the cylindrical tank; exchangeable transducers enable algorithm testing with varying transducer frequencies and beam geometries. High speed data acquisition (DAQ) through a dedicated National Instrument PXI setup streams digitized data directly to the host PC. System positioning error has been quantified and is within limits for the desired imaging modality. Imaging of various objects including: calibration objects, phantoms, bone, animal tissue, and human forearm are presented accordingly.},
